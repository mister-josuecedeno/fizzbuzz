## Objective

The Fizzbuzz coding challenge was invented in 2007 by Imran Ghoryin in order to assess developer competence.

Since its conception the Fizzbuzz challenge has been used by Facebook and Microsoft as interview tools and has also been taught at Stanford, Berkley, Caltech and countless other universities.

## Instructions

Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100.

But for multiples of three print “Fizz” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”.

For numbers which are multiples of both threeand five print “FizzBuzz”.
